# Body-Heat-Map-

This code provides a framework to create a body heat map that highlights different parts of the body. 

This was used to create a visualization of injuries during a year for a sports team.

It includes an interactive widget and can be customized to add different body locations, color maps, and ways to import the data. 

The interactive widget can be deleted or grayed out and will not affect the rest of the code. 

I am open to any suggestions to making this better, I am still new to this!
